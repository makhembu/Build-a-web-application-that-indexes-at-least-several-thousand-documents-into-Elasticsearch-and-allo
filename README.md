# Build-a-web-application-that-indexes-at-least-several-thousand-documents-into-Elasticsearch-and-allo
This code defines a Flask app that exposes two endpoints: /index and /search. The /index endpoint allows you to index a document in Elasticsearch by sending a POST request with the document as the request body. The /search endpoint allows you to search for documents in Elasticsearch by sending a GET request with the search query as a query parameter (e.g. /search?q=my+query). The search.html template is used to render the search page, where users can enter their search query and view the search results.

To use this web application, you will need to install Flask and Elasticsearch. You can do this by running the following command:


pip install flask elasticsearch

After installing the required packages, you can start the web application by running the following command:


python app.py

You can then access the search page at http://localhost:5000/ and index and search for documents using the /index and /search endpoints.
